|  this is an implementation of |
|  conway's Game of Life,       |
|  implemented by Ted Meyer     |
|  for CS 2303.                 |

+===============================+

This program will run conway's game of life
through the command line. To do so, first build
the program using:
	make && make clean

then run the program as such:
	./life <x> <y> <itr> <filename> <print> <pause>

if you chose to print the values, be careful that 
you are using a fixed with font in a terminal that 
has at least a width equal to x+2. I surrounded each 
state with a border (like in the header of this file)

there are some example configurations in tests/ as well 
as a shell script that will run them and pipe them to files

DESIGN CHOICES
	I used a single array instead of a double array. I 
	think its a better way to do it, and I talked to 
	Professor Lauer, and he said it was OK as long as it 
	worked properly.

LOOP INVARIANTS
	these are all pretty obvious. most of them are for loops 
	that go from 0 to a specified width or height. the only 
	one that is slightly confusing is the while loop for 
	reading in the file, which tests the equality of a 
	temporary value with EOF immediatly after that temporary 
	variable has had the next character stored in it. 

NOTES:
	in the input files, use x for alive, and o for dead.
		any other character counts as an o.

	if the grid in the input file is smaller than the
		dimensions provided, it will be centered.

	DO NOT put in rows with different lengths. I cannot
		promise that there won't be a segfault for such 
		silly inputs.

	YOU MUST use a fixed width terminal / text editor. 
		or else. >:D

	FINALLY I am not checking your inputs. if you dont 
		put in numbers for x y and iterations, there 
		will be a segfault. <print> and <pause> are
		optional, and must be either 'y' to work.
