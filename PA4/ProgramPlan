Program plan:

add all the customer arrivals at once, sorted by arrival time
	time = TIME ENTERING BANK
			or
	time = TIME LEAVING BANK

create a teller event for each teller with a random end time
	time = TELLER AVAILIBLE



clock = integer
 starts at 0

unsorted queues (bank lines)
 one, or one for each teller



pull first item off queue
	if it is a TELLER:
		if there is an availible customer:
			insert new customer event for leaving time
		else
			insert new teller event with random idle time

	if it is a CLIENT:
		if it is an entering event:
			get shortest queue, insert customer at the end of it
		if it is a leaving time:
			insert a teller event with time = current clock value


to get random:

	rand() % (max_time-clock) + clock
