#===================#
|      Summary      |
#===================#
	This is the event driven simulation problem (obviously).
	FIRSTLY:
		excuse the ugliness of this code.
	SECONDLY:
		there are some issues with running a simulation with
		large numbers. I ran ./qSim 10000 100 60 300, and it
		used 26GB of my ram in 15 seconds. 
	THIRDLY:
		./qSim [#customers] [#tellers] [#time (in minutes)] [#time (in seconds)]
		I counted my program by seconds instead of by minutes,
		As I found it gave more consistent results due to the
		lack of having to compute floating point numbers.
	FOURTHLY:
		obviously, my classes are named differently than the
		assignment specifies:
			Customer -> CustomerEvent
			Teller -> TellerEvent
			Event -> BankEvent
			EventQueue for the queue (not a struct);
			the "Action" method is called "onCompletion()"
	LASTLY:
		there is another optional flag to put into the program,
		after a seed is specified. adding the number 1
		will cause extra print statements, as well as the require
		the anykey to be pressed in order to advance the
		simulation. 



#===================#
|      analysis     |
#===================#
	It seems after running the tests a few times that the single
	queue is better.
